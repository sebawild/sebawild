* Hi, I'm Sebastian; I'm an assistant professor in computer science at Liverpool.
* I'm interested in algorithms and data structures and their mathematical analysis, for example [engineering sorting algorithms](https://www.wild-inter.net/posts/powersort-in-python-3.11); 
  but also in computer science education, psychology, AI, game theory, (some) politics, and typography.
* Check [my website](https://www.wild-inter.net) for more info on my research, teaching, school-outreach activities, and contact.
